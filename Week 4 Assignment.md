Mean
========================================================

- What is mean?

Mean is the sum of a given set of numbers, divided by the how many numbers in the set.  
It is also refered to as an average.

- How does this affect the plot?

The mean of X and Y shifts where the center of the data points are on the respective axis.    

Standard Deviation
========================================================
- What is standard deviation?

Standard Deviation is the is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 

- How does this affect the plot?

The standard deviation will adjust the spread of points on the plot.  

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set.
A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Using the App
========================================================
Now that we have an understanding on how mean and standard deviation can affect a scatter plot, the app in the next slide can help visualize these changes.  

For both x and y, select the mean and standard deviation.  These inputs will be used in a normal distribution random number generator to select 20 points to plot for X and Y.  

### Helpful hints
- To see the shift in means better, make standard deviations low.
- See what happens when you make X standard deviation high and Y low.
