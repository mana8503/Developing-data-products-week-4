Mean
========================================================
- What is mean?

Mean is the sum of a given set of numbers, divided by the 
how many numbers in the set.  
It is also refered to as an average.

- How does this affect the plot?

The mean of X and Y shifts where the center of the data 
points are on the respective axis.  

Standard Deviation
========================================================
- What is standard deviation?

Standard Deviation is the is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. 

- How does this affect the plot?

The standard deviation will adjust the spread of points on the plot.  

A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean of the set.
A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
